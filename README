This is a small tool that can assist in linux early user-mode software
debug process. It sets up a virtual environment for QEMU that can launch
almost instantly.

What do you need to do:
1. Copy some linux kernel to a file called "kernel" next to this file.
   (the one on your computer should do)
2. Imperatively describe FS structure in "populate-image.sh".
3. # make
4. $ ./run.sh

If you want to change the filesystem:
1. Stop all VMs using the image.
2. # ./mount.sh
3. Do whatever you need to do.
4. # ./umount.sh

Files:
Makefile - a top-level makefile. Requires root permissions to tinker with
           loop devices and mounts.
mount.sh - mounts the image to the "image" directory
umount.sh - umounts it
